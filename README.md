# Bad-Python-App
For use in DTS L7 CETM65: Software Engineering Principles

An example of a Python App that functions as expected but is written to a poor standard.

There are several bad coding practices scattered throughout the app and you need to identify and rectify them.

You may find issues with the code that I have not intended (please point them out :))
