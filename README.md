# Bad-Python-App
For use in DTS L7 CETM65: Software Engineering Principles

An example of a Python App that functions as expected but is written to a poor standard.

There are several ***bad coding practices*** scattered throughout the app and you need to identify and rectify them.

Reference the previous lecture on ***Code Quality*** for ideas (don't stop there though :))

You may find issues with the code that I have not intended (please point them out :))


Instructions:

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Run code with:
    ``` python main.py ```
